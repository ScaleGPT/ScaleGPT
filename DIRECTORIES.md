 **Here's a suggested directory structure for your software development framework, combining best practices and considerations for its unique GPT-driven approach:**

**Root Directory:**

* **framework.py** (or similar): Main entry point for the framework
* **requirements.txt** (or similar): List of required dependencies
* **README.md** (or similar): Comprehensive documentation
* **config.py** (or similar): Configuration settings for the framework
* **logs/**: Directory for storing framework logs

**Subdirectories:**

* **roles/**: Contains code and configuration for different GPT roles
    * **product_manager/**
    * **architect/**
    * **project_manager/**
    * **engineer/**
* **models/**: Stores trained GPT models for each role
* **data/**: Contains input requirements and generated outputs
    * **requirements/**
    * **user_stories/**
    * **competitive_analysis/**
    * **data_structures/**
    * **apis/**
    * **documents/**
* **templates/**: Houses templates for generated outputs
* **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests
* **lib/**: Additional libraries or modules used by the framework

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Version Control:** Utilize Git or a similar system for tracking changes.
* **Modularity:** Design for flexibility and potential expansion of roles or features.
* **Testing:** Implement thorough testing strategies for quality assurance.
* **Data Management:** Consider storage, retrieval, and versioning of generated outputs.
* **GPT Integration:** Explore techniques for seamless integration of GPT models within the framework.
* **GPT Training:** Address model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation for domain-specific accuracy.
* **Collaboration:** Facilitate multi-role collaboration and conflict resolution.
* **Project Management:** Incorporate project management features for tracking progress and tasks.

**Remember:** This structure can be adapted to align with your specific project needs and preferences.
